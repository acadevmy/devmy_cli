# Standards

In this section, all the standards and conventions adopted to standardize the applications developed in Devmy are summarized.
Implementing uniform standards is crucial for ensuring consistency, maintainability, and code quality across all projects.
These principles not only facilitate collaboration among team members but also ensure that applications are easily understandable and scalable over time.
Following these guidelines helps reduce the risk of errors and improve development efficiency, allowing teams to focus
on innovation and problem-solving rather than managing discrepancies in the code.

## Big Picture

![Big Picture Scheme](/pages/index/big-picture.png)

The main idea is to create a cohesive and easy-to-use structure for developers, favoring centralization rather than scattering resources.
The standardized commands in the package
(`dev`, `build`, `start`, `test`, `e2e`, `lint`, `release`) are not just predefined scripts; they represent the only scripts necessary
for any application. We should add new scripts only in cases of extreme necessity.
If something requires more complex management, it needs to be analyzed and integrated into an npm (or pub) script.

For example, for integrating [Cypress](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cypress), instead of creating new scripts in the package, we developed
[@devmy/cypress-runner](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@devmy/cypress-runner) so that it can be used by everyone without
adding complexity to the package commands, thus maintaining a high developer experience.
The same principle applies to the [dotenv Vault](https://www.dotenv.org/docs/security/env-vault) file in the project root
with prefix filtering: it is designed to be shared with all applications, centralizing configurations in a single point
without duplicating them in [Gitlab](https://www.gitlab.com) environment variables or other pipeline systems.

Regarding configurations, instead of replicating information in [Gitlab CI/CD Variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables), we created
[@devmy/dotenv2shell](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@devmy/dotenv2shell) to load [Dotenv Vault](https://www.dotenv.org/docs/security/env-vault) environments into the execution
shell of GitLab pipelines. This approach enhances the developer experience and promotes centralization of configurations.
