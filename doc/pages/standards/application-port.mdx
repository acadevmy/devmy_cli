### Application Port

Regarding the ports for launching various applications, we have standardized them to centralize and unify the setup. This approach eliminates the frustration of remembering the specific port for the frontend application built with a particular framework in a given project. The standardized ports are:

| target   | port | localhost      |
|----------|------|----------------|
| Frontend | 4000 | localhost:4000 |
| Backend  | 3000 | localhost:3000 |

This standardization ensures a cohesive development environment and simplifies the process for developers.
