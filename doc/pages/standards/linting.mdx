# Linting

To improve code quality and maintain consistency across different projects,
we have implemented a linting standard for all development teams at Devmy.
To this end, we have developed the npm package [@devmy/eslint-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@devmy/eslint-plugin),
which provides common and framework-specific linting rules used by the teams.

## Advantages of Standardization

By implementing `@devmy/eslint-plugin` and adopting standardized linting rules, we have achieved the following advantages:

- **Consistency**: All projects follow the same rules, facilitating code readability and maintenance.
- **Better Code Quality**: Linting rules help prevent common errors and improve the overall quality of the code.
- **Ease of Integration**: Integrating the package into existing projects is straightforward and does not require invasive changes.

## Package Structure

The `@devmy/eslint-plugin` package is designed to be easy to use and integrate into existing projects. The linting rules are divided into two main categories:

1. **Recommended Rules**: These rules are included in the `@devmy/eslint-plugin/recommended` set and must be used in all projects. They cover best practices and common conventions that every project should follow.

2. **Framework-Specific Rules**: To support specific frameworks and libraries, we have developed additional rule sets that extend the recommended rules. For example, for Angular projects, the `@devmy/eslint-plugin/angular-recommended` set is available, which inherits rules from the recommended set and adds framework-specific rules for Angular.

## Configuration

To configure linting in a project, simply install the `@devmy/eslint-plugin` package and add the appropriate configuration to the `.eslintrc.[cjs|mjs|js]` file. Here is an example of basic configuration:

```javascript
module.exports = {
    extends: [
        '@devmy/eslint-plugin/angular-recommended' // Framework-specific rules for Angular (already includes recommended rules)
    ],
    rules: {
        // Custom rules can be added here
    }
};
```
