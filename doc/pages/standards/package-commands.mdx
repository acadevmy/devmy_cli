# Standardized Package Commands

The package manager is standardized with the following commands:

- `dev`: Launches the monorepo (or single application) in development mode, activating hot-reload. NX builds the libraries that the single project depends on.
- `build`: Executes the production build of the entire monorepo (or single application). NX builds the libraries that the single project depends on.
- `start`: Starts the applications compiled with the production build (or single application). NX runs the build for the single project and all its dependencies.
- `lint`: Performs lint operations on the project or the monorepo.
- `lint:fix`: Performs lint fixes on the project.
- `test`: Runs tests on the project or the monorepo.
- `test:headless`: Runs tests in headless mode, useful for pipelines.
- `e2e`: Runs end-to-end tests.
- `e2e:headless`: Runs end-to-end tests in headless mode, useful for pipelines.

## Design Pattern Composite

By adopting the same interface for the package in sub-projects through NX, we implement the Composite Design Pattern. This pattern allows us to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly through a common interface.

## Benefits of the Composite Design Pattern

- **Uniform Access**: Simplifies the development and maintenance process by reducing dependency on specific implementation details.
- **Modularity and Reusability**: Promotes modularity and code reusability by allowing individual objects and compositions to be treated the same way.
- **Agnostic Pipelines**: Allows pipelines to be written in a way that is completely agnostic of the project they are working on.
