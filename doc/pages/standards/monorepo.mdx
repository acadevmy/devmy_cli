# Monorepo - NX

Each Devmy project is configured as an NX monorepo, allowing centralized management of all related applications and leveraging NX's caching mechanisms for builds.

## Benefits of the NX Monorepo

- **Centralized Management**: Manage all applications in a single repository.
- **Build Cache**: Uses NX cache to optimize builds, reducing compilation times.
