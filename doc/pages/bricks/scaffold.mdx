# Scaffold

It allows you to create an NX monorepo, into which applications and libraries are inserted.

## Advantages

### Scripts

The scripts have been configured so that all applications and libraries within the monorepo can be started or built
at the same time.

| Script | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| dev | Run in developer mode |
| start | Run in production mode |
| build | Runs the build |
| lint | Find all lint problems |
| lint:fix | Find all lint problems and solve them |
| test | Runs unit tests in watch mode |
| test:headless | Runs the unit tests and prints the result |
| e2e | Runs E2E tests in watch mode |
| e2e:headless | Runs E2E tests and prints the result |

### Cache

Devmy CLI simplifies cache management for applications and libraries. This means it won't be necessary
manually configure cache policies.

### Dotenv Vault

During the initialization of the scaffold, the setup of [Dotenv Vault](https://github.com/dotenv-org/dotenv-vault) is also started
A tool that allows you to synchronize environment variables between machines, environments and teams.

### Semantic Release

The [Semantic Release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) configuration for versioning is already present in the scaffold
of the project.

### Husky

We have also configured [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) for commit linting.

## Get Started

To create scaffolding for a project you need to use the Devmy CLI and launch the command:

```bash copy
devmy new
```

## Variables

You can configure the initial scaffold with the following parameters:

- **Workspace name**: The name of the scaffold
