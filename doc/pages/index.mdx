# Devmy CLI

Welcome to the Devmy CLI documentation!

## What is Devmy CLI?

Devmy CLI is a [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) which allows you to create monorepo and applications within it
in a fast and structured way, configuring cache management, environment variables and application optimizations,
allowing the developer to have a project ready to start working on.

## Why Devmy CLI?
The Devmy CLI was created with the aim of simplifying and optimizing the process of creating and managing NX monorepo,
providing a set of tools and standards that facilitate the work of developers.

1. **Creation of Optimized Monorepos:**
The Devmy CLI is designed to create highly optimized NX monorepos. NX is a powerful platform for managing monorepos,
but configuring it optimally can be complex. Devmy CLI automates this process, ensuring that the monorepo created
is configured according to best practices and takes full advantage of the potential of NX. This allows you to get an environment
of more coherent and high-performance development right from the start.

2. **Reduction of Common Work:**
One of the main goals of the Devmy CLI is to reduce the joint work needed to start a new project. Often, the
Creating a new project requires a series of repetitive steps and configurations that can be automated. The Devmy
CLI eliminates much of this manual work, allowing developers to focus on more important and specific aspects
of their project. By automating tasks such as initial configuration, dependency installation, and build
basic structures, the Devmy CLI makes the setup process much faster and more efficient.

3. **Application of Common Standards:**
Another crucial reason why the Devmy CLI was created is to apply common standards across different technologies.
In complex development environments, it is critical to maintain consistency across various projects and components.
The Devmy CLI enforces coding, configuration, and structure standards that ensure that all projects within the monorepo
follow the same guidelines. This not only improves code quality, but also facilitates maintenance and collaboration
between different development teams

### Glossary

This glossary provides clear and concise definitions of key terms used in the Devmy CLI documentation.

- **Add-on**: It is a set of operations and code blocks that are inserted into an already generated application and/or library.
- **Application**: Executable within the monorepo which can use 0-n libraries and communicate with 0-n other applications.
Application examples: frontend in Angular or NextJS backend with NestJS or Aws functions, Firebase, etc.
- **Brick**: Script-generated application, library or extension. The scaffold itself is a brick imported into the cli.
- **CLI**: The command line application that takes the bricks and generates the code for us.
- **Library**: Utilities that can be used by applications in the monorepo. the DTO library shared between frontend and backend plugin engine.
- **Project**: The monorepo and all the applications and libraries it contains
- **Scaffold**: The bare monorepo structure without projects and libraries.
