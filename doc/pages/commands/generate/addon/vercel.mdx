# Vercel

The Devmy CLI provides a set of predefined configurations that will allow you to start developing right away.

Vercel Addon automates the process of setting up the Vercel configuration for
the current application, making it ready for deployment. It performs the
following tasks automatically:

1. Requests Vercel Tokens:
For both the staging and production environments, you will be asked to
provide their respective Vercel tokens. You can obtain these tokens by
visiting:
https://vercel.com/account/tokens

2. Updates the CDCI file:
The command will modify your (GitLab CI) configuration to include deployment
steps for both staging and production environments.

3. Populates .env.vault variables:
The script will automatically insert environment variables into the
.env.vault file for both staging and production.


**IMPORTANT:**
- Separate Vercel accounts:
This command assumes that staging and production are hosted on two separate
Vercel accounts. Using the same token for both environments will result in
deployment issues. Make sure to provide distinct tokens for each environment.

- Account access:
If you do not have access to the Vercel accounts for staging or production,
please contact your project lead or admin to request access before running
this setup.

## Get Started

To add a new vercel configuration, use the following Devmy CLI command:

```bash copy
devmy generate addon vercel
```

## Manual configuration

in case you want to manually configure the vercel configuration you will have to insert the vercel.json file into
your application.
see the [official documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/project-configuration).
this is a sample `vercel.json` which is usually applied by this addon:

```json copy
{
    "version": 2,
    "regions": ["cdg1"],
    "framework": "angular",
    "installCommand": "echo \"Install (SKIPPED): pnpm deploy bundles local libraries into node_modules. Running pnpm install again would overwrite them.\"",
    "buildCommand": "pnpm build",
    "outputDirectory": "dist"
}
```

### Environment

Once you have defined the `vercel.json` file you will need to include the following variables in .env.vault production
and staging areas:

```dotenv
[APPLICATION_PREFIX]_VERCEL_PROJECT_ID=[application project id]
[APPLICATION_PREFIX]_VERCEL_ORG_ID=[application organization id]
[APPLICATION_PREFIX]_VERCEL_TOKEN=[application vercel token]
```
To get `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` and `VERCEL_ORG_ID` you will have to manually link the project to vercel using the vercel
CLI command [vercel link](https://vercel.com/docs/cli/link) command and retrieving them from the `./.vercel/project.json`
file. The operation must be repeated for the staging environment and for the production environment.

To get the vercel token, you will have to manually generate it at https://vercel.com/account/tokens
(make sure you are logged in to the right account).

### Pipelines

#### Gitlab

Once you have defined the `vercel.json` file you will need to include the `vercel.yml` file in your `.gitlab-ci.yml`

```yaml copy

include:
  - file: /gitlab-ci/common.yml
    project: pillar-1/devops
    ref: v1.1.6
  - file: /gitlab-ci/vercel.yml
    project: pillar-1/devops
    ref: v1.1.6
```

and configure staging and production jobs. to do this, simply create jobs that inherit from `.deploy-vercel` and
`.deploy-staging` if you are configuring the staging environment or `.deploy-production` if you are configuring
production.

here is an example:

```yaml copy
"[STAGING] My App":
  extends:
    - .deploy-staging
    - .deploy-vercel
  variables:
    APPLICATION_PREFIX: MY_APP
    APPLICATION_NAME: my-app

"[PRODUCTION] My App":
  extends:
    - .deploy-production
    - .deploy-vercel
  variables:
    APPLICATION_PREFIX: MY_APP
    APPLICATION_NAME: my-app
```

**Pay attention**: `APPLICATION_PREFIX` refers to the prefix used by dotenv-vault for its variables,
while `APPLICATION_NAME` corresponds to the application name specified in its package.json
