# Gitlab

The Devmy CLI provides a set of predefined configurations that will allow you to start developing right away.

Gitlab Addon automates the process of setting up the gitlab configuration for
the current workspace, making it ready for CI/CD environment. It will create the
following files automatically:

1. .gitlab-ci.yml
automatically creates the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file including all the common steps of all the projects defined in the
[Devmy devops project](https://gitlab.com/pillar-1/devops)

2. Merge request template
automatically creates and configure the `.gitlab/merge_request_templates/merge_request_template.md` file including all
the common sections of all projects


**IMPORTANT:**
- Add environment variables:
once the command is finished, it will invite you to configure some environment variables on gitlab.
Do it now or it will be your business and you will have to manually recover them later.

## Get Started

To add a new vercel configuration, use the following Devmy CLI command:

```bash copy
devmy generate addon gitlab
```

## Manual configuration

in case you want to manually configure the gitlab configuration you will have to do following steps.

### .gitlab-ci.yml

You will have to insert the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file into
your application.
this is a sample `.gitlab-ci.yml` which is usually applied by this addon:

```yml filename=".gitlab-ci.yml" copy
include:
  - file: /gitlab-ci/common.yml
    project: pillar-1/devops
    ref: v1.1.6
```

### Merge request

You will have to create and configure the `.gitlab/merge_request_templates/merge_request_template.md`.

```markdown filename="merge_request_template.md" copy

```
this is a sample `.releaserc.js` which is usually applied by this addon:

```js filename=".releaserc.js" copy
const { env } = require('@dotenv-run/core');

env({
  files: ['.env.vault'],
});

/**
 * @type {import('semantic-release').GlobalConfig}
 */
const releaseConfig = {
  branches: ["main"],
  plugins: [
    "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer",
    "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator",
    "@semantic-release/changelog",
    "@semantic-release/npm",
    ["@semantic-release/gitlab", { assets: ["CHANGELOG.md"] }],
    [
      "@semantic-release/exec",
      {
        prepareCmd: "pnpm version ${nextRelease.version} --allow-same-version --no-commit-hooks --no-git-tag-version -ws --no-workspaces-update",
      },
    ],
    [
      "@semantic-release/git",
      {
        assets: [
          "CHANGELOG.md",
          "package.json",
          "package-lock.json",
          "applications/**/package.json",
          "libraries/**/pnpm-lock.yaml"
        ],
        message:
          "chore(release): ${nextRelease.version} [skip ci]\n\n${nextRelease.notes}",
      },
    ],
  ],
};

module.exports = releaseConfig;
```
