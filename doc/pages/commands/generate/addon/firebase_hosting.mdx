# Firebase/Hosting

The Devmy CLI provides a set of predefined configurations that will allow you to start developing right away.

The firebase/hosting addon allows you to automatically select and configure applications within the monorepo
to be used as [hosting for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting). When you run the command, the CLI
will prompt you to choose the application where the changes will be applied, and you'll need to select the project
containing the Firebase configurations.
After that, a list of monorepo applications compatible with this feature will be displayed.

The plugin will check for any already configured applications to prevent accidental overwrites.

By selecting the desired applications, the plugin will automatically integrate them into the Firebase configuration.

## Get Started

To add a new firebase hosting configuration, use the following Devmy CLI command:

```bash copy
devmy generate addon firebase/hosting
```
