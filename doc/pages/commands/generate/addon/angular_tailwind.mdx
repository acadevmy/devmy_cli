# Angular/Tailwind

The Devmy CLI provides a set of predefined configurations that will allow you to start developing right away.

The addon will take care of installing the necessary dependencies and initializing the library of
[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) so that it is ready to use immediately.

## Get Started

To add a new tailwind configuration, use the following Devmy CLI command:

```bash copy
devmy generate addon angular/tailwind
```
