# Angular

The Devmy CLI provides a set of predefined configurations that will allow you to start developing right away.

devmy generate library angular
```
or

devmy g l angular
```

or

```bash copy
devmy g l ng
```

is a modular version of Lodash, designed to be used with ECMAScript (ES) modules.

### Test
