## Addons

### Vercel

Both during the creation phase of the Next application and afterwards, it will be possible to add [Vercel](/commands/generate/addon/vercel) deploy configuration.

The addon will take care of installing the necessary dependencies and initializing the CDCI so that it is ready to use immediately.
