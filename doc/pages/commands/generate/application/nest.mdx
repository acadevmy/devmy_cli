# NestJS

[Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/) is a NodeJS framework, heavily inspired by Angular, that allows building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications.

## Get Started

To create a new NestJS application, use the following Devmy CLI command:

```bash copy
devmy generate application nestjs
```

## Variables

You can configure the initial application with the following parameters:

- **Application name**: The name of the application
- **Port**: Port to listen on.

## Advantages

### Axios

[Axios](https://axios-http.com/) is a library for making HTTP requests from Node.js or the browser. In a NestJS application, Axios can be used to handle communications with external APIs easily and flexibly.

### Class Transformer and Class Validator

These libraries work together to transform and validate objects in TypeScript. class-transformer allows transforming plain JavaScript objects into instances of classes and vice versa, while class-validator enables applying and verifying validation rules on objects.

More information here:

- [Class Transformer Documentation](https://github.com/typestack/class-transformer#readme)
- [Class Validator Documentation](https://github.com/typestack/class-validator#readme)

### Cookie Parser

[Cookie Parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookie-parser) is a middleware that parses request cookies and populates req.cookies with a key-value object. This is useful in a NestJS application for handling cookie data.

### DayJs

[Day.js](https://day.js.org/docs/en/installation/installation) is a date manipulation library that provides an API similar to Moment.js but with smaller size and better performance.

### Helmet

[Helmet](https://helmetjs.github.io/) is a middleware that helps secure Express (and thus NestJS) applications by setting various HTTP headers related to security. It is particularly useful for preventing common vulnerabilities like XSS and clickjacking attacks.

### Sentry

[Sentry](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/nestjs/) is a platform for monitoring application errors and performance. In a NestJS application, Sentry can be used to track exceptions, errors, and performance, providing useful details for debugging and improving applications.

The Sentry configuration has been integrated into the project and uses the following environment variables:

```bash copy
[ApplicationName]_SENTRY_DNS
```

### Swagger

[Swagger](https://docs.nestjs.com/openapi/introduction) is a suite of tools for designing, building, and documenting APIs. With NestJS, @nestjs/swagger allows automatic generation of Swagger documentation based on decorators and metadata in the code.

### Throttler

[Throttler](https://docs.nestjs.com/security/rate-limiting) is a module that provides rate limiting for HTTP requests. In a NestJS application, Throttler can be used to prevent abuse and limit the number of requests to certain APIs.
