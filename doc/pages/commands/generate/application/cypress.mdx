# Cypress

The Cypress brick is already configured to automatically start all necessary environments before running the tests.
Additionally, it uses Cucumber syntax to make test writing more similar to task structure, making test scripts easier to understand and maintain.

## Get Started

To create a new Cypress application, use the following Devmy CLI command:

```bash copy
devmy generate application cypress
```

- To run the end-to-end tests and view them in a **browser**, use the command: `pnpm run e2e`.
- To run the end-to-end tests and view the results in the **terminal**, use the command: `pnpm run e2e:headless`.

## Variables

You can configure the initial application with the following parameters:

- **Application name**: The name of the application
- **baseUrl**: URL used as prefix for `cy.visit()` or `cy.request()` command's URL.
- **webServerCommands**: The commands to execute via cypress-runner to start all the frontends and all the backends necessary for the tests.
- **waitOnUrls**: The urls that must be alive via cypress-runner in order to start the cypress tests.

## Advantages

### Cucumber Syntax

The [cypress-cucumber-preprocessor](https://github.com/badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor) library allows you to use Cucumber syntax to write tests in Cypress.
This combination enables you to describe tests in a readable, specification-based format that can be easily understood even by non-technical team members. Here is a brief explanation of the Cucumber syntax applied to Cypress:

#### Feature File

**.feature** files are where test scenarios are written using the Gherkin language. Each file describes a specific feature through a series of scenarios. The basic structure of a feature file includes keywords such as:

- **Feature**: Describes the functionality under test.
- **Scenario**: Describes a single test case with specific context.
- **Given**: Sets up the initial conditions for the test.
- **When**: Describes the action that is performed.
- **Then**: Describes the expected output or result.

**Example:**

```gherkin copy
Feature: User login

  Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
    Given the user is on the login page
    When the user enters valid credentials
    Then the user should be redirected to the dashboard
```

#### Step Definitions

**Step definitions** are JavaScript or TypeScript files that map the steps described in the feature files to executable code.
Each step defined in the feature file must have a corresponding implementation in the step definitions.

**Example**

```javascript copy
import { Given, When, Then } from "cypress-cucumber-preprocessor/steps";

Given("the user is on the login page", () => {
  cy.visit("/login");
});

When("the user enters valid credentials", () => {
  cy.get('input[name="username"]').type("user");
  cy.get('input[name="password"]').type("password");
  cy.get('button[type="submit"]').click();
});

Then("the user should be redirected to the dashboard", () => {
  cy.url().should("include", "/dashboard");
});
```

### Selector by data-test attribute

A selector has been added that allows elements to be selected based on a custom HTML attribute `data-test=[id]`. This enables the use of selectors specifically for e2e tests, avoiding the use of CSS selectors which may change over time and cause tests to fail.

#### Usage

1. Attach the `data-test` selector to an HTML tag:

```html
<h1 data-test="title">Hello World!</h1>
```

2. Use the custom selector in the Cypress file to retrieve it:

```typescript
cy.getByDataTest("title").should("contain", "Hello World!");
```
