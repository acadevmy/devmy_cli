# Angular

The Devmy CLI provides a set of predefined configurations that will allow you to start developing right away.

## Get Started

To create a new Angular application, use the following Devmy CLI command:

```bash copy
devmy generate application angular
```

## Variables

You can configure the initial application with the following parameters:

- **Application name**: The name of the application
- **Prefix**: The prefix to apply to generated selectors for the project.
- **Port**: Port to listen on.

## Advantages

### Ngrx

The Angular application created with the Devmy CLI comes with [NgRx](https://ngrx.io/) preinstalled and configured,
including the Store, DevTools, and Effects. NgRx is a state management library inspired by Redux, which simplifies state management
in complex Angular applications.

### Lodash

The Angular application includes [lodash-es](https://lodash.com/) as a preinstalled dependency, a JavaScript utility library. Lodash-ES
is a modular version of Lodash, designed to be used with ECMAScript (ES) modules.

### I18n

The Angular application created with the Devmy CLI comes with preconfigured support for internationalization (i18n) using
[ngx-translate](https://github.com/ngx-translate/core) and the
[@larscom/ngx-translate-module-loader](https://github.com/larscom/ngx-translate-module-loader) plugin. This advanced setup
allows for flexible and highly configurable translation management, organizing translation files into folders and using separate
namespaces to avoid conflicts between translation keys.

With this configuration, translation files should be organized into folders by module or feature. For example, the folder structure could be:

```bash
/assets
  /i18n
    /common
      /en.json
      /it.json
    /feature1
      /en.json
      /it.json
    /en.json
    /it.json
```

### Test

The Angular application created with the Devmy CLI is preconfigured to use Jest as the unit testing framework, replacing Karma and Jasmine.
Jest is a modern and versatile testing library that offers superior performance, simpler setup, and advanced features like snapshot testing.

#### Why Jest?

Using Jest provides numerous advantages over Karma and Jasmine:

- **Speed**: Jest is known for its speed and reliability, thanks to its ability to run tests in parallel and built-in support for watch mode.
- **Simplicity**: Jest offers straightforward and immediate setup, with zero configuration required for many common functionalities.
- **Snapshot Testing**: Jest supports snapshot testing, allowing for easy and precise verification of component output.
- **Broad Compatibility**: Jest is compatible with TypeScript and offers specific presets for Angular support.

### Ngxtension

The Angular application created with the Devmy CLI includes support for NgxTension, a versatile library that provides a set of advanced
extensions and modules to enhance Angular application development. NgxTension offers ready-to-use solutions for common needs such as
authorization management, advanced form configuration, and more, significantly simplifying the creation of complex applications.

### Sentry

Also included is a preconfigured setup for [Sentry](https://sentry.io/), a tool for error monitoring and management. Sentry helps detect,
diagnose, and resolve issues in applications in real-time, thereby improving code quality and user experience.

The Sentry configuration has been integrated into the project and uses the following environment variables:

```bash copy
[ApplicationName]_SENTRY_DNS
[ApplicationName]_SENTRY_TRACE_SAMPLE_RATE
[ApplicationName]_SENTRY_REPLAY_SAMPLE_RATE
[ApplicationName]_SENTRY_REPLAY_ON_ERROR_SAMPLE_RATE
[ApplicationName]_SENTRY_TRACE_PROPAGATION_TARGETS
[ApplicationName]_BASE_API_URL
[ApplicationName]_FORCE_UPDATE_INFORMATION_PARAM
```

Once you've created the Angular application with the Devmy CLI, it's essential to properly configure the environment variables
to integrate Sentry and monitor errors and performance.

### Router

A configuration for routing has also been included in the `app.config.ts` file by adding
`withComponentInputBinding()` and `withViewTransitions()` as providers to the router.

#### Retrieving Information from the Router

Through the `withComponentInputBinding()` provider, you can retrieve information directly from the router parameters
and pass them as inputs into components.

```typescript
// app.routes.ts
{ path: 'heroes/:id', component: HeroDetail },


// hero-detail.component
@Input()
set id(heroId: string) {
  this.hero$ = this.service.getHero(heroId);
}
```

#### Transition Animations between Pages

To further enhance the user experience, the `withViewTransitions()` provider has been added, introducing transition animations
between pages during navigation. This makes interaction with the application smoother and visually appealing.

This provider enables view transitions in the Router by executing the route activation and deactivation inside of
document.startViewTransition.

## Addons

### TailwindCSS

Both during the creation phase of the Angular application and afterwards, it will be possible to add [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

The addon will take care of installing the necessary dependencies and initializing the library so that it is ready to use immediately.
